Trick to find out what the command's name for a key binding. E.g. I don't know what the name of the command associated with `Cmd + W`. Go to keyboard shortcuts, search for tab and pick a random tab command that has no key binding. Then, try to add `Cmd + W` key binding to it. VSCode will warn that there are already existing commands and you can see what they are. Alternatively, put the command in bracket and search in keyboards i.e. search for `"cmd + w"`
